# Machine Learning Project 1-Fall 2021

## Description

This project is part of the EPFL Machine Learning course for fall 2021 and was implemented by Younes Moussaif, Pauline Conti and Cl√©mence Barsi

The aim of this project is to implement 6 machine learning models using solely the numpy library and to optimize accuracy on the test set using pre-processing steps. To obtain our test accuracy, we uploaded our submissions to AIcrowd.


## How to use

To run our best performing model, the script ```run.py``` must be ran having the files test.csv and train.csv in a folder Data. The predictions will be generated in an output.csv file.


## Content of our project 

- ```cross_validation.py``` contains all our methods used for cross-validation
- ```eda_preprocessing.py``` contains our methods used to explore the data and to pre-process the data, handling invalid values, redundant features...
- ```grid_search.py``` contains the functions we created to select the hyper-parameters that achieved the best accuracy
- ```implementations.py``` has the definition of the 6 models asked and the methods needed to run them
- ```pipeline.py``` has the pipeline used for our best performing model
- ```plots.py``` contains the code to create the plots included in the report
- ```proj1_helpers.py``` are the helpers provided in the template of the project to create our submission on AIcrowd
- ```run.py``` is the script that creates the best predictions in the test set.
